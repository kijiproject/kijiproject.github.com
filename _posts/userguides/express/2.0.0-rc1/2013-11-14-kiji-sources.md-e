Scalding provides the `Source` abstraction for reading and writing data as a part of flows. Express
provides the `KijiSource` for reading and writing data to Kiji tables, and `HFileKijiSource`s for
writing data to HFiles.  The following sections will explore how to use `KijiSource` and
`HFileKijiSource` as part of flows.

Contents:

* [KijiInput](#kijiinput) is for reading from a Kiji table.
* [KijiOutput](#kijioutput) is for writing to a Kiji table.
* [HFileKijiOutput](#hfilekijioutput) is for writing to HFiles that will be bulk-loaded into Kiji.

## KijiInput

`KijiInput` specifies how data should be read from a KijiTable and converted into tuples in a flow.
Each row from the Kiji table will populate a single tuple, but the fields of the tuple and whether
the fields hold a column or an entire column family is configurable.  Additionally, `KijiInput`
allows specifying a specific timerange of cells to be read from the table.

The tuples that result from using a `KijiInput` contain a field per input column in the map.  Each
field will contain a [`Seq`](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.Seq)
of `Cell` objects.  A Scala `Seq` is very similar to List, and it supports many higher-order Scala
operations such as `map`, `filter`, and `fold`.  `Cell` objects are simple data containers which
hold the `family`, `qualifier`, `version` (or timestamp), and `datum`.  The `datum` field holds the
value of the cell, and can be accessed with `myCell.datum`.

The basic KijiInput syntax looks like this.  More details on configuration options follow.

Here are the parameters to KijiInput:

| Parameter | Required? | Default value |
| ------------- | ------- | -------- |
| [timeRange](#specifying_a_timerange_optional) | no | All |
| [Column to Field Mapping](#specifying_a_column_to_field_mapping_required) | yes | -- |

</br>
Here are the parameters to QualifiedColumnInputSpec and ColumnFamilyInputSpec:

| Parameter | Required? | Default value |
| ------------- | ------- | -------- |
| [maxVersions](#maxversions) | no | 1 |
| [schemaSpec](#schemaspec) | no | Writer |
| [filters](#filters) | no | no filter |
| [paging](#paging) | no | Off |

### Specifying a Timerange (Optional)

Timestamps in Kiji, like timestamps in HBase, can be used as actual timestamps for the data in a
table, or to attach version numbers to cells.  You should be careful when attaching
version semantics to timestamps, as noted [in this blog
post](http://www.kiji.org/2013/02/13/common-pitfalls-of-timestamps-in-hbase/).

You can specify an optional time range, or range of versions, on a **KijiInput**.  (Note that the
time range is applied to the entire input request and not a single column. You can further control
how many versions of an individual column are returned by using `maxVersions` described further
ahead.).  This time range limits the data returned from all the columns you request to that
time range.  The default time range is `All`, which imposes no limits on the data from the columns
of the table.

Here are the provided constructors for a TimeRange:

    timeRange = Before(1000L)
    timeRange = After(1000L)
    timeRange = Between(1000L, 2000L)
    timeRange = All

The time range is an optional parameter to KijiInput, so your construction will look something like
what follows:

    KijiInput.builder
        .withTableURI("kiji://localhost:2181/default/users")
        .withTimeRange(Before(1000L))
        .withColumnSpecs(
            QualifiedColumnInputSpec.builder
                .withColumn("userinfo", "email")
                .withMaxVersions(2)
                .build-> 'email,
            ColumnFamilyInputSpec.builder
                .withFamily("purchases")
                .withMaxVersions(all)
                .build-> 'purchases)
        .build

Note that this means the `’email` field will contain only the data in the `userinfo:email` column
that has version numbers before 1000L.  Since we only requested a maximum of 2 versions of that column,
this means we get the most recent 2 versions of the user’s email before version 1000, even if there are
more after version 1000.  This also means the `'purchases` field contains all the purchases that fall
within the specified `timeRange` for this `KijiInput`, not all purchases that are in the users
table.

### Specifying a Column to Field Mapping (Required)

`KijiInput` takes a one-to-one mapping from `ColumnInputSpec` to field name, as an argument to the
constructor function. This map defines the Kiji columns that will be read into specific fields of
the flow.

An exmaple KijiInput syntax looks like this:

    KijiInput.builder
        .withTableURI("kiji://localhost:2181/default/users")
        .withColumns("info:name" -> 'name, "purchases" -> 'purchases)
        .build

This constructs a KijiInput that reads from the specified table, the specified columns "info:name"
and "purchases" and puts the contents of those columns into the fields `'name` and `'purchases`
respectively.

However, to specify further options on the columns that you request data from, you must use the
following syntax:

    KijiInput.builder
        .withTableURI("kiji://localhost:2181/default/users")
        .withColumnSpecs(
            QualifiedColumnInputSpec.builder
                .withColumn("info", "name")
                .build -> 'name,
            ColumnFamilyInputSpec.builder
                .withFamily("purchases")
                .build -> 'purchases)
        .build

`QualifiedColumnInputSpec` is used to specify a single Kiji column should
be read into a single field in each tuple.  `ColumnFamilyInputSpec` is used to specify an entire
column family should be read into a single field in each tuple; it is particularly useful for
reading map-type column families.

In both cases, additional options on how to read the column exist, such as number of versions,
filters, paging, and schema.

#### maxVersions

    import org.kiji.express.flow
    builder.withMaxVersions(2)
    otherBuilder.withMaxVersions(all)

`maxVersions` is an Integer specifying the number of versions of this column to be in the tuple.  By
  default, this is 1, so you will only get the latest version within the time range of the entire
KijiInput request.

#### schemaSpec

This specifies the Avro schema with which to read the data in this column.  For more information about Avro schemas, see the [KijiSchema userguide]({{site.userguide_schema_1_4_0}}/managing-data) section on Schema evolution.
Here are the options:

* `SchemaSpec.Specific(classOf[MySpecificRecordClass])`: used when you have a specific class
  that has been compiled by Avro.  `MySpecificRecordClass` must extend
`org.apache.avro.SpecificRecord`
* `SchemaSpec.Generic(myGenericSchema)`: If you don’t have the specific class you want to use to
  read, you can construct a generic schema and use it as the reader schema.
* `SchemaSpec.Writer`: used when you want to read with the same schema that the data was written
  with.  This is the default if you don’t specify any `SchemaSpec` for reading.
* `SchemaSpec.DefaultReader`: specifies that the default reader for this column, stored in the
  table layout, should be used for reading this data.  If you use this option, first make sure
the column in your Kiji table has a default reader specified.

#### filters

By default, no filter is applied, but you can specify your own.  Only data that pass
these filters will be requested and populated into the tuple.  Two column filters are currently
provided: `ColumnRangeFilterSpec` and `RegexQualifierFilterSpec`.  Both of these filter the data
returned from a ColumnFamilyInputSpec by qualifier in some way.  These filters can be composed with
`AndFilterSpec` and `OrFilterSpec`.  Filters are implemented via HBase filters, not on the client
side, so they can cut down on the amount of data transferred over your network.

* `ColumnRangeFilterSpec(minimum = “c”, maximum = “m”, minimumIncluded = true, maximumIncluded =
  false)`:  Specifies a range of qualifiers for the cells that should be returned.  In this
example, it returns all data from all columns with qualifiers “c” and later, up to but not including
“m”.  All of the parameters are optional, so you can write `ColumnRangeFilterSpec(minimum = “m”,
minimumIncluded = true)` to specify columns with qualifiers “m” and later.
* `RegexQualifierFilterSpec(“http://.*”)`: Specifies a regex for the qualifier names that you
  want data from.  In this example, only data from columns whose qualifier names start with
“http://” are returned.
* `AndFilterSpec(List(mRegexFilter, mQualifierFilter))`: The `AndFilterSpec` composes a list of
  `FilterSpec`s, returning only data from columns that satisfy all the filters in the
`AndFilterSpec`.
* `OrFilterSpec(List(mRegexFilter, mQualifierFilter))`: Is analagous to `AndFilterSpec`, but
  returns only data from columns that satisfy at least one of the filters.  `OrFilterSpec` and
`AndFilterSpec` can themselves be composed.

##### paging

    builder.withPagingSpec(PagingSpec.Cells(10))

Specifies the number of cells per page.  By default, `paging = PagingSpec.Off`, which disables
paging.  With paging disabled, all cells from the specified column will be loaded into memory at
once.  If the size of all of the loaded cells exceeds the capacity of the receiving machine's main
memory, the Scalding job will fail at runtime.  In these cases you can specify `paging =
PagingSpec.Cells(10)` to load only 10 cells at a time.  The appropriate number of cells to be paged
in depends on the size of each cell. Users should try to retrieve as many cells as possible (without
causing an out of memory exception) in order to increase
performance.

See “A Note on Paging” below for more information about usage and pitfalls of paging.

### A Note on Paging

If paging is enabled on a `ColumnInputSpec`, then the resulting fields will contain a `Seq` with
lazy evaluation semantics, that is, any transformations on the collection will only retrieve the
requested `Cell`s from HBase when they are needed.  This has several important performance
implications:

  * Cells will only be retrieved from HBase as they are needed, so if a job does not use the cells,
    no further paging will be triggered.
  * Full evaluation of the `Seq` can be triggered by performing an operation over entire `Seq`, such
    as `map` or `filter`.
  * Holding a reference to the `Seq` and triggering a full evaluation **will** result in the full
    sequence of `Cell`s being in heap at once.  To avoid this, do not hold a reference to a `Seq`
which will be fully evaluated.  For example, the following shows the correct way to filter a `Seq`
of `Cell`s which may be bigger than the heap size down to a more manageable collection without
running out of memory:

    // If you need cells with datum < 10 and you are confident that all those cells fit in memory
    val inMemoryList = seq.filter{cell: FlowCell[Int] => cell.datum < 10}.toList

  * In particular, sorting a `Seq` will entirely materialize the `Cell`s in memory, thus if the
    `ColumnInputSpec` specifies reading more values from the Kiji column or column family than will
fit in heap, an `OutOfMemoryError` will occur.

## KijiOutput

`KijiOutput` specifies how data should be written to a KijiTable from an existing pipe. Care must be
taken that the `entityId` field exists in the pipe you are writing, which will be used as the row key
in the Kiji table. You can use `EntityId` to create this field from existing fields that make up the
components of the entity Id. The types for these components should match those of the existing
table.

{% highlight scala %}
pipe
    .map((‘product_name, ‘product_type) -> ‘entityId) { tuple: (String, Int) =>
      EntityId(tuple._1, tuple._2)
    }
// ...
{% endhighlight %}

The basic KijiOutput syntax looks like this (details about the specific configurations follow):

![KijiOutput Syntax][kiji_output]

[kiji_output]: ../../../../assets/images/kiji-output.png

Here are the parameters to KijiOutput:

| Parameter | Required? | Default value |
| ------------- | ------- | -------- |
| [timeStamp](#specifying_the_timestamp_optional) | no | no timestamp field |
| [Field to Column Mapping](#specifying_a_field_to_column_mapping_required) | yes | -- |

</br>

Here are the parameters to QualifiedColumnInputSpec and ColumnFamilyInputSpec:

| Parameter | Required? | Default value |
| ------------- | ------- | -------- |
| [schemaSpec](#schemaspec) | no | Writer |

### Specifying the Timestamp (Optional)

If you wish to control the timestamp, or version, of the cell that gets written to the Kiji table,
you may specify the field which contains this information. Again, care must be taken while handling
timestamps manually. You can read more about this
[here](http://www.kiji.org/2013/02/13/common-pitfalls-of-timestamps-in-hbase/).

### Specifying a Field to Column Mapping (Required)

In this simplest case, this may be specified as a mapping from the field name in the pipe to the
fully qualified column name of the table.

{% highlight scala %}
    KijiOutput.builder
        .withTableURI("kiji://localhost:2181/default/mytable")
        .withColumns(
            'column1 -> "info:column1",
            'column2 -> "info:column2"
        ).build
{% endhighlight %}

As with KijiInput, we have provided syntactic sugar for the most common case of writing a field to a
column, using the default schema. Here “`info:column1`” is the fully qualified name of the column.

You can write fields into either a Group Type Column or Map Type Family using
QualifiedColumnOutputSpec and ColumnFamilyOutputSpec respectively. You can read more about these
column types [here](http://docs.kiji.org/userguides/schema/1.3.2/managing-data/).

#### QualifiedColumnOutputSpec

This is used to indicate writing to a column in a Group Type Family. You will need to specify both
the family and qualifier. These may be specified as two separate strings - one for family, and

You may optionally specify a schema. By default, the schema attached to or inferred from the value
will be used.

The SchemaSpec is specified in much that same way as for KijiInput, which is described
[above](#schemaSpec)

#### ColumnFamilyOutputSpec

This is used to write to a Kiji Column Family. It requires that you specify the name of the family.
It also requires a field in the pipe that will indicate the qualifier where this value will be
written.

The SchemaSpec is specified in much that same way as for KijiInput or QualifiedColumnOutputSpec.

The SchemaSpec is specified in much that same way as for KijiInput, which is described
[above](#schemaSpec)

{% highlight scala %}
   KijiOutput(
       tableUri = "kiji://localhost:2181/default/mytable",
       columns = Map('column1 -> ColumnFamilyOutputSpec("myMapTypeFamilyName",
           ‘qualifierField)))
{% endhighlight %}

## HFileKijiOutput

The `HFileKijiSource` is a special write-only source that allows for the contents of a pipe to be
written to HFiles for later bulk loading into HBase. From an API perspective, writing a Scalding job
that writes to HFiles is as simple as:
* Writing to `HFileKijiOutput` instead of `KijiOutput`.  They are the same except `HFileKijiOutput`
  requires a `hFileOutput` parameter that specifies where the HFiles are output by the job.

{% highlight scala %}
         // Create an HFileKijiOutput that writes to the table named `mytable` putting timestamps in the
         // `'timestamps` field and writing the fields `'column1` and `'column2` to the columns
         // `info:column1` and `info:column2`. The resulting HFiles will be written to the "my_hfiles"
         // folder.
    HFileKijiOutput.builder
        .withTableURI("kiji://localhost:2181/default/mytable")
        .withHFileOutput("my_hfiles")
        .withTimestampField('timestamps)
        .withColumns(
            'column1 -> "info:column1",
            'column2 -> "info:column2"
        ).build
{% endhighlight %}

HFiles written this way will be placed in a directory called hfiles under the specified HFileOutput directory.
