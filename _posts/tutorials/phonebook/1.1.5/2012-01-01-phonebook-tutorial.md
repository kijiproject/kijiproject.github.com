description: Quick tutorial to get up and running with Kiji Tables.
---

We assume that our incredibly popular user, **you**, needs a big-data solution
for your phone book. We will thus walk you through the process of defining a
layout for your phone book, creating a Kiji table with this layout and looking
up an entry. The current text file you have been using to store your contacts
resides at `$KIJI_HOME/examples/phonebook/input-data.txt` and we also show you how
to bulk load this into your Kiji table.

Example code for a more in depth look at these use cases exist in the directory
`$KIJI_HOME/examples/phonebook/src/main/java`.  Instructions for how to build and use this
example code can be found in the next section of this tutorial,
[Setup]({{site.tutorial_phonebook_1_1_5}}/phonebook-setup).
